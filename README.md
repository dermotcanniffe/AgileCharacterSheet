# AgileCharacterSheet

This is a sample Character Sheet for Agile Testers or Engineers.
The Character Sheet leverages ideas discussed in the author's Agile Testing Days 2023 talk "How to make an awesome Character sheet for Agile Teams"

Broadly speaking, if we use an approach similar to roleplaying games' character sheets to design our own self-narrative, it can help us focus on how we wish to be perceived and progress within an Agile team. 

The Sheet PDF includes an example page (page 1) and an editable page (page 2) for the user's own details.

This is the initial phase of sharing this document. If people wish to download and edit it, please feel free. I'm open to expanding the concept within the community, so by all means contact me on my various socials and we can discuss.
